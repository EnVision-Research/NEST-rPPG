function AFEv = comput_AFEv(segment)

%comput_AFEv takes the RR intervals segment (column vector) 
%and computes AFEv

%Inputs
%segment:   RR intervals segment (column vector)

%Output
%AFEv:   feature for detection of Atrial Fibrillation



%Compute dRR intervals series 
dRR=comp_dRR(segment);

%Compute metrics
[OriginCount,IrrEv,PACEv]=metrics(dRR);

%Compute AFEvidence
AFEv=IrrEv-OriginCount-2*PACEv;
